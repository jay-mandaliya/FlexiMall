### Conclusion
---
Project FlexiMall is very useful for the regular customers for purchasing items in real-time superstore. As this application is available for mobile devices so most of users can use this application. The main purpose of this project is to reduce the time and the efforts of the customer while shopping. 

This is done by generating the virtual cart in mobile device in which customer can add any product item through scanning the barcode. Once the barcode is successfully scanned the item is added to the virtual cart and afterwards user can also customize the quantity of the product. Due to this facility user has not to worry for carrying item as once it is added to the cart. At last user can review the shopping items and the price of the cart items once the shopping is completed. The items ordered are brought to the billing counter and consumer can pay the bill once the items are verified as ordered. This project aims at reducing the task of both the users and the superstore staff.
